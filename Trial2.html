I am going to try to inset an image and see what happens. Its not going to be the size I have in mind though as I havent edited it as per my liking.

<img src = "F:\pujo 2012\Dp.jpg" alt="My image"/>
<p> <br></br> You're not seeing the image. You're seeing the image description which is for broken images and especially for screen readers. I checked this on my phone and this is what I was expecting. So I don't really understand this image thing yet. </br> <br> I'll try to see if I can do something about the image size.</br> <br></br>
<img src= "F:\Image0397.jpg" alt="The soft toy that used to travel pg-home-pg"/>
<br> </br> It works. <br> </br> Tata.
